    <p>There's nothing worse than losing your family's financial security in the autumn of life because of  long term care costs. You just helplessly watch as your life savings and your retirement accounts are  drained month after month as your costs of care go up and up. You realize that you will soon have  nothing to fall back on, no security. You think about how you will not be able to leave anything for  your kids.</p>

    <p>You start thinking, <strong>“But legal planning is expensive, and I don't like attorneys.”</strong> </p>

    <p>Of course, you could always come up with your own plan to navigate the complicated and punitive  Medicaid regulations...</p>

    <h2 class="text-primary border-bottom-secondary">Why I Help People with Asset Protection</h2>
    <p>My grandparents worked hard all their lives and never spent much money.  
      I saw how easily everything could be lost. Even as an attorney, I was  
      unsure how to help them preserve their money in their twilight years.  
      Since my grandparents passed, I set about learning the mysteries of  
      elder law and specifically the Medicaid laws and regulations.
    </p>

    <p>I have read books, articles and attended many days of training and seminars, and have handled many cases to become one of the few attorneys who practice Elder Law /Medicaid /VA Pension Planning. It is a highly regulated and complex area of the law, with many potential pitfalls.</p>

    <p>In the last 10 years, I have helped many families in getting their nursing or assisted living paid for through  Medicaid while legally keeping their assets in the family. It is what I would do for my own family, so it is what I am happy to do for my clients.</p>

    <h2 class="text-primary text-bold uppercase text-center">With the Krause Medicaid Process, You'll Get:</h2>
    <div class="grid-4-col">

          <p>In late 2019 my wife entered an assisted living facility due to dementia. I was paying the entire fee for this service and it was very expensive. My financial advisor suggested I should engage with a lawyer to protect our assets... Dan (Krause) outlined a process that he has had extensive experience with wherein our assets would be protected....  In less than 6 months I will save all of the fee I paid Dan in the saving from having my spouse be on Medicaid. I strongly recommend Dan Krause.</p>

    <p>By now, you're probably wondering how much The Krause Medicaid Process costs. Before I answer that, let me ask you a question. <em class="text-medium">How much would you spend to...</em></p>
      
      <p>Keep from losing all of your assets while receiving assisted living or nursing care?</p>
      
      <p>Be guided through the asset protection and Medicaid application process by caring professionals?</p>
      
      <p>Have a friend in the legal community that your family can rely on?</p>

      <p><em class="text-medium">The Krause Medicaid Process gives you all that and more.</em></p>
      
      <p>
        If you had to pay out of pocket for your care, you could expect to spend <em class="text-medium">$600,000 </em>or more. I'm making The Krause Medicaid Process available for a fraction of that. <em class="text-medium">It costs just about what you would pay for two months of nursing care.</em>

      <p><strong>But that's not all. Act today, and I'll also include:</strong></p>

    <h3 class="text-secondary">Comprehensive Estate Plan</h3>

    <p>Because we want to give people the same advantages we would give our family members, I'm offering it at  a value price we cannot disclose in this format.
